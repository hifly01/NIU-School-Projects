# NIU-School-Projects - Please read first
Here are some of my school coding assignments that I have done at Northern Illinois University from 2016-2020. C++ was a main focus as well as using a UINUX based operating system to submit most assignments throughtout our classes. 

This repository is for showing companies some of the assignments I have done. The classes I have taken are:

*CSCI 240 Computer Programming in C++ - C++ 
*CSCI 241 Intermediate Programming - C++ 
*CSCI 330 UNIX and Networking Programming - Linux 
*CSCI 340 Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis - C++ 
*CSCI 360 Computer Programming in Assembler Language - Assembly 
*CSCI 463 Computer Architecture and Systems Organization - C++ and UINUX/Shell scripting 
*CSCI 465 Enterprise Application Enviornments - COBOL

NOTE: some of my classes I do not have the programs for or do not have all of them. This is due to my laptop harddrive becoming corrupted and not everything was able to be recovered. 

SECOND NOTE: I have worked with a partner in some classes. These are all mine and any parnter's work
